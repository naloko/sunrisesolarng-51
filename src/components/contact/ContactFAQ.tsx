      question: "How much does a solar installation cost?",
      answer: "Solar installation costs vary based on your energy needs, property size, and system specifications. We provide free consultations and detailed quotes tailored to your specific requirements. Our residential systems typically range from â‚¦2-8 million, while commercial installations are priced based on scale and complexity."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does installation take?",
      answer: "Residential installations typically take 1-3 days, depending on system size and roof complexity. Commercial projects usually take 1-2 weeks, including all electrical work and grid connection. We provide a detailed timeline during your consultation and keep you updated throughout the process."
    },
    {
      question: "What maintenance is required?",
      answer: "Solar systems require minimal maintenance. We recommend annual professional inspections and occasional cleaning to ensure optimal performance. Our comprehensive maintenance packages include system monitoring, cleaning, and performance optimization to maximize your investment."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide warranties?",
      answer: "Yes, we provide comprehensive warranties on all installations. Solar panels come with 25-year performance warranties, inverters have 10-15 year warranties, and our installation work is covered for 5 years. We also partner with leading manufacturers to ensure long-term support."
